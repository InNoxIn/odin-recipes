    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of flavors and textures. It typically consists of wide, flat pasta sheets alternated with hearty fillings like a robust meat sauce or a vegetable medley, creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and topped with melted mozzarella or Parmesan. The dish is baked to perfection, resulting in a golden, bubbling crust with a satisfying blend of tender noodles and savory fillings. Originating in Italy, lasagna has become a beloved comfort food worldwide, often personalized with various ingredients like spinach, mushrooms, or different cheeses, making it both versatile and delicious.</p>
